C/C++ sample code

This is a Visual Studio express 2013 for Windows Desktop project. 
It is a presonal proyect used to try different C/C++ features when I need them for my work. Yes, the typical project 
'Test' that all developers have. 

I don't use C/C++ very often so it doesn't intend to be a big reference project, but I've decided to share it
just in case it might be help to someone, or the community is interested in expanding it with their tests.
